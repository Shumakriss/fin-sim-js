# TODO

Just a list of things I'd like to do eventually!

* Make inputs look nice
* Fix up mobile presentation
* Fetch default stats dynamically
* Use cookies or database to preserve settings 
* Add mortage calculator
* Add mortage+payoff retirement calculators
* Coming out of retirement calculator

## Complications

All of these things get potentially complicated. For example:
* Nice inputs might require new frameworks, how to ensure compatibility, etc.
* Mobile presentation is limited by Google Sites, is it worth a rewrite?
* Dynamically fetching stats is amazing but they rarely change, might need to be scraped, might break over time
* Cookies aren't super safe and databases cost money and performance
* Mortgages have lots of interesting details that may be hard to determine (equity)
* Many people sell homes and buy new ones or reverse their mortgage

So, I have to be diligent with where I spend my time.
